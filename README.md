# CyberTA - Discord Queue Bot

CyberTA was designed in the COVID-19 pandemic to help Operating Systems TAs with their queue based office hours. The inspiration came from other twitch.tv bots that allowed users to be put in a queue for games. It uses Discord.js and Heroku apps to create a 24/7 bot that monitors multiple text-channels. 

# Commands
  - `!ping` - simple test that responds "pong"
  - `!next` - adds a user to queue and responds with user's position in queue, (optional: `!next + 'issue description'` ),
  - `!queue` - view the queue w/ user name, issue description, how long they've been waiting
  - `!undo` - quickly undo the next call that put the user in queue
  - `!remove` - takes a index paramater (i:e remove 2), removes user from queue at certain index, alerts user that TA is ready, deletes user's !next call
  - `!ready` - removes user from top of the queue, alerts user that the TA is ready, deletes !next call from top user, tells time spent on previous team (if available)
  - `!online` - enables !next command, sets TA to online
  - `!offline` - disables !next command, sets TA to offline
  - `!clear` - clears the queue and deletes all `next` messages that were in the queue
  - `!help` - provides list of commands and their functions

### Dependencies
CyberTA uses the following tech:
* [Discord] - Based communication software
* [Discord.js] - chat bot language
* [Heroku] - used for hosting the bot 

### Deploying CyberTA with Heroku
These instructions are for installing CyberTA to a Heroku application. You will need a GitHub, Heroku, and discord developer account as well as manage server permissions to a Discord server.

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account, or an account you have access to.
##### Heroku Instance
* With Github Student Developer Pack, you will have access to more hour usage credits *
1. Create a new app, call it whatever you'd like (only you will see this).
2. For deployment method, choose Github, search for your fork and connect.
3. Once it has connected successfully a new section called "Manual deploy" will appear, deploy master to pull the code from GitHub.
4. The Heroku instance will now install dependencies, and you will need to configure the app.
##### Discord Bot
6. Goto https://discord.com/developers/applications.
7. Create a new application (again, call it whatever you'd like, this is for you).
8. Once you have created your app, add a bot and copy the bot token.
9. If you'd like to change the username field now, this is what will your bot will be called.
9. Go back to your Heroku app settings, under 'Settings', reveal config vars.
10. Create a new variable `BOT_TOKEN` and paste your copied token.
11. On your Discord server right click the channel you wish to designate for the TA's to manage the queue (You may need to hold shift) and click 'Copy ID'.
12. This ID will be the `TA_CHANNEL` config var on Heroku.
13. Do the same for the office hours channel creating a `OFFICE_HOURS` config var with the corresponding ID on Heroku.
14. To add this Bot to your server, go to https://scarsz.me/authorize. You can find your client Id from the Discord application settings, under 'General Information'.
15. Choose the server you'd like to deploy the bot to, and 'Authorize'. 
16. Back on Heroku, under the 'Resources' section you should now have two Dynos a web and a node worker. Disable the web and enable the node worker.
17. This will restart the application and your bot should not be functional.

### TO:DOs

 - Persistent Queue (Heroku does not support persistent file storage, so this may need a database)
